Why SNACK?
===========

Background
------------

Consider an office environment with its network topology shown in Figure 1.

*Figure 1. Oversimplified office network topology*

For some reason, many of the employee addicted in accessing social media,
thus affecting their performance. The IT department cannot block all access to social media services since they have
a Social Media department that needs constant access to those services in order to do their job. They also cannot
fully block social media access to the others since it considered censoring information to the employee, which is
breaking human rights.


Here comes SNACK
------------------

Time-limiting can be the solution to get the balance between productivity and information access.
The employee can still access social media services for certain duration, before it gets blocked as a sign to
get back to work. In this situation, accessing social media can be considered as snacking rather than slacking.

That it is where the name SNACK comes from. As it names, Social Network Access Connection Kontroller,
we aim to control the connection to the social media services that accessed by the employee. 


Why use SNACK?
------------------

The advantages in using SNACK for the employer are:
- The employees in the Social Media department will have unlimited access to social media services
- The employees in other department will have time-limited access to social media services
  - They can access a service for an hour, before getting blocked for another hour
  - The blocking will be done per service (e.g. blocked from accessing X/Twitter does not mean blocked from
    accessing Facebook) which can be useful to see how addicted the employee in accessing the social media
- Access to productivity services are not affected

Thanks to SNACK, the employer have their employee less slacking, and the employee still have their 'snack'
which is accessing social media services.  
Happy employer, ~~(hopefully)~~ happy employee.
